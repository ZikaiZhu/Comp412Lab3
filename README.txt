Parser.py(the parser), Scanner.py(the scanner), FlagHandler.py(the flag handler), DoublyLinkedList.py(the class that I wrote for the IR, including the renaming algorithm and the allocation algorithm), lab2.py(where it handles the commands) are the source codes for my frontend project. 412alloc is the script to start the program.
